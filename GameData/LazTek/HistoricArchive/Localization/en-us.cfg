	// Parts
		#LHA-eng-draco-titl = SuperDraco Twin Engine Nacelle
		#LHA-eng-draco-desc = Twin SuperDraco engines and nacelle radial mount to attach to SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. These are designed to be used as emergency escape thrusters or for powered landings, using the MMH/NTO hypergolic mixture contained in the spacecraft.

		#LHA-heatshield-falcon-titl = Falcon Heat Shield Fairing
		#LHA-heatshield-falcon-desc = 2.5m PICA-X protective heat shield with top decoupler for headfirst reentry of Falcon upper stage.

		#LHA-heatshield-habitat-titl = Dragon Explorer Habitat Heat Shield
		#LHA-heatshield-habitat-desc = 2.5m PICA-X protective heat shield with bottom decoupler for atmospheric entry of SpaceX Explorer Habitat module.

		#LHA-jet-pulse-titl = SuperDracoPulse Engine Nacelle
		#LHA-jet-pulse-desc = Advanced hybrid pulseJet engines contained in a radial mount to attach to SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft. Switchable between air-breathing and closed system modes, these engines are designed to be used to assist with reaching return orbit from planetary bodies with heavy atmospheres..

		#LHA-ladder-retractable-titl = Dragon Retractable Ladder
		#LHA-ladder-retractable-desc = Lightweight retractable ladder designed for Dragon spacecraft.

		#LHA-nosecone-retractable-titl = Dragon Retractable Nose Cone Intake
		#LHA-nosecone-retractable-desc = Retractable nose cone/air intake for atmospheric interplanetary missions. Need this for use with the pulse-jet engine pods.

		#LHA-pod-dragon2-titl = DragonRider Capsule
		#LHA-pod-dragon2-desc = The seven-seat, reusable manned 2.5m Dragon spacecraft is equipped with six-axis Draco RCS Thrusters, interior and exterior lighting, retractable landing gear and opening hatch.  A PICA-X heatshield is built in for atmospheric returns.  Contains fuel for Draco/SuperDraco engines, batteries, supplies, and life support.

		#LHA-solar-mini-titl = Dragon Mini Solar Array
		#LHA-solar-mini-desc = Small, recessed solar panels for interplanetary SpaceX Dragon missions.

		#LHA-trunk-titl = Dragon Docking Trunk
		#LHA-trunk-desc = 2.5-meter utility trunk, battery and monopropellant tank designed to have a docking port attached to it to allow redocking with Dragon spacecraft. Solar panels and covers are attached to it in pairs.
